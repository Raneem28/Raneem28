- 🤞 Mission: I'm a 19-year-old AI student at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, and I want to start a coding YouTube channel to help Pakistani students succeed in tech. I believe Pakistan is full of talent, but we lack the proper guidance to reach the levels of countries like India and the USA. Many successful students don't give back, but I aim to change that. Once I get proficient in coding, I'll share my knowledge to help others excel. Inshallah, we can make a difference together! 🌟💻
